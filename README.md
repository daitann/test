      <h2><p style="text-align:left">My Artist Statement:</p></h2>
      <p>I found a passion for drawing from a very young age. I loved drawing as a hobby, or rather, I love to create things as a hobby. Since childhood, I would be drawing or crafting things. I would draw characters from Mario to Pokemons that I saw on T.V. I would be creating things like duct tape wallets to origami and paper planes. I’ve always been entertained with the aesthetic of creativity and art, but to be honest, I never found it as anything more than a hobby. My skills quickly drained up and I never sought to improve. However, two years into Highschool, I joined a program called Multimedia, which is a program that teaches you the basic necessity of the digital art world. I learned programs such as Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign, Premiere Pro, Animate, and much more. From that point on, I wanted to make this passion of mine into a lifelong career.
        
      <br><br>

      There were many people who inspired me as I was growing up. Tom and Jerry, Looney Toons, and Pokemon were the very first interaction I had to creative arts and animations that drove me into the person I am today. My dream is to become a world-class animator like Makoto Shinkai or Hayao Miyazaki. Their works are meant to inspire young artists like me to keep following our dreams. Because they were once people who went through the same steps we are going through today. They had to climb the ladder of success and through hard work and diligence, they got to a place where they can proudly say all their efforts paid off. They represent those who have dreams but lack the resources to achieve them. You should not let anything prevent you from what you want to do. Whether it’s the technology, skills, or mindset, you must overcome everything to achieve whatever it is you want. 

      <br><br>

      I have learned many platforms to extend my skillset and variety to be able to accomplish as much as I want. Photoshop is my preferable platform for 2D art, Blender or Maya is preferred for 3D modeling and animation, and Adobe Animate is my platform of choice for your traditional hand-drawn 2D animation. I realized that this pathway will be a very difficult one, however, it is one with the most satisfiable end reward. I want to become a very successful animation in the future, along with having very successful side jobs such as a small store, or even an animation channel on youtube. Everything I have learned up until now was mainly by myself. I managed to self teach myself as much as I possibly can, and would rely on my teachers for things relating to their assignments. Learning how to animate was very tough. I had to learn the 12 basic principles of animation, which was very fun to understand and learn. The most difficult part of my self-teaching was 3D modeling. Learning meshes and vertices and rendering and lighting was such a great and wonderful, yet most difficult experience for me so far. Still, with time and practice, I know I will be able to achieve the standards I have set myself to become the best possible animator I can become.
